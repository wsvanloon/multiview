Februari 4, 2021 - Version 0.3.0
- multiview is now licenced under GNU GPLv2
- Added a new function MVS() which provides a more modular approach to multi-view stacking.
- MVS() allows the application of StaPLR with more than 2 levels.
- MVS() outputs objects of S3 class MVS which have associated coef() and predict() methods.
- Added an option to StaPLR to skip training the meta-learner. The meta-learner is automatically skipped when only one view is provided.
- Added an option to StaPLR to skip the generation of cross-validated predictions.
- StaPLR output no longer contains the original training data.
- The default number of folds for StaPLR is now 10 (was 5)
