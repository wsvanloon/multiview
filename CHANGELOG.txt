February 23, 2021 - Version 0.3.1
- MVS() now correctly applies nonnegativity constraints at the intermediate level(s) if specified.
- The MVS() example has been modified slightly.

February 4, 2021 - Version 0.3.0
- multiview is now licenced under GNU GPLv2
- Added a new function MVS() which provides a more modular approach to multi-view stacking.
- MVS() allows the application of StaPLR with more than 2 levels.
- MVS() outputs objects of S3 class MVS which have associated coef() and predict() methods.
- Added an option to StaPLR to skip training the meta-learner. The meta-learner is automatically skipped when only one view is provided.
- Added an option to StaPLR to skip the generation of cross-validated predictions.
- StaPLR output no longer contains the original training data.
- The default number of folds for StaPLR is now 10 (was 5)
- The default value of lambda.ratio is now 1e-04 (was 0.01).
- By default, StaPLR no longer checks the version of glmnet, nor does it make suggestions on which version to use. If desired, the version check can still be enabled by using StaPLR(..., skip.version=TRUE).
- The R project file has been removed and is no longer tracked in the repository.
